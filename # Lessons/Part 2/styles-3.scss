/*
  Modules
  - You donâ€™t have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in your compiled output!

// styles.scss
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
