/*
  Private Members
  - As a stylesheet author, you may not want all the members you define to be available outside your stylesheet. Sass makes it easy to define a private member by starting its name with either - or _. These members will work just like normal within the stylesheet that defines them, but they wonâ€™t be part of a moduleâ€™s public API. That means stylesheets that load your module canâ€™t see them!


**************************

  ðŸ’¡ Fun fact:
  - If you want to make a member private to an entire package rather than just a single module, just donâ€™t forward its module from any of your packageâ€™s entrypoints (the stylesheets you tell your users to load to use your package). You can even hide that member while forwarding the rest of its module!
