/*
  Advanced Variable Functions
  - The Sass core library provides a couple advanced functions for working with variables. The meta.variable-exists() function returns whether a variable with the given name exists in the current scope, and the meta.global-variable-exists() function does the same but only for the global scope.

*/

// ⚠️ Heads up!
// Users occasionally want to use interpolation to define a variable name based on another variable. Sass doesn’t allow this, because it makes it much harder to tell at a glance which variables are defined where. What you can do, though, is define a map from names to values that you can then access using variables.
@use 'sass:map';

$theme-colors: (
  'success': #28a745,
  'info': #17a2b8,
  'warning': #ffc107,
);

.alert {
  // Instead of $theme-color-#{warning}
  background-color: map.get($theme-colors, 'warning');
}
