/*
  Quoted Strings
  - In most cases, interpolation injects the exact same text that would be used if the expression were used as a property value. But there is one exception: the quotation marks around quoted strings are removed (even if those quoted strings are in lists). This makes it possible to write quoted strings that contain syntax that’s not allowed in SassScript (like selectors) and interpolate them into style rules.

.example {
  unquoted: #{'string'};
}

/*
  ⚠️ Heads up!
  While it’s tempting to use this feature to convert quoted strings to unquoted strings, it’s a lot clearer to use the string.unquote() function. Instead of #{$string}, write string.unquote($string)!
