/*
  Operators
  - Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, math.div(), and %. In our example we’re going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an article and aside.

*/

@use 'sass:math';

.container {
  display: flex;
}

article[role='main'] {
  width: math.div(600px, 960px) * 100%;
}

aside[role='complementary'] {
  width: math.div(300px, 960px) * 100%;
  margin-left: auto;
}

// We’ve created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in Sass let us do something like take pixel values and convert them to percentages without much hassle.
