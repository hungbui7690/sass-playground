/*
  Choosing a NamespaceChoosing a Namespace permalink
  - By default, a module’s namespace is just the last component of its URL without a file extension. However, sometimes you might want to choose a different namespace—you might want to use a shorter name for a module you refer to a lot, or you might be loading multiple modules with the same filename. You can do this by writing @use "<url>" as <namespace>.
